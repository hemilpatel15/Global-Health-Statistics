# 🌍 Global Health Statistics Analysis & Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global healthcare data to uncover insights into access, income disparities, and health outcomes across different regions. It involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, machine learning, and data visualization to derive actionable insights and present them in an interactive format.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Programming**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Tableau
- **ML Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest

## 🧹 Data Preparation

- Handled missing values and inconsistencies using **Pandas** and **NumPy**
- Standardized formats and cleaned the dataset for analysis and modeling

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing:
  - Health access across income groups
  - Regional disparities in outcomes
  - Correlation between variables like income and life expectancy

## 🤖 Machine Learning

- Developed predictive models:
  - **Linear Regression** for baseline modeling
  - **Random Forest** for improved performance and feature importance analysis
- Evaluated using:
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **R² Score**

## 📈 Interactive Dashboard

- Created an interactive dashboard in **Tableau** to:
  - Visualize key findings
  - Highlight feature importance
  - Support data-driven policy and business decisions

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- Income level and healthcare access are strongly correlated with health outcomes
- Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression in predictive accuracy
- Dashboard provides a high-level summary for stakeholders and decision-makers
